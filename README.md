# Zomato Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of Zomato sales data using Python, specifically leveraging libraries such as Pandas, Polars, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The objective is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset to guide potential restaurant openings, focusing on optimal restaurant types, locations, and service offerings.

## Installation Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dilip19IT19/zomato-Sales-Analysis-Report.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd zomato-Sales-Analysis-Report
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas polars seaborn matplotlib
   ```

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Polars**: For efficient data processing.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced visualizations based on Matplotlib.

## Data Pre-Processing
The data pre-processing steps include:
- Dropping unnecessary columns.
- Renaming columns for clarity.
- Removing duplicate entries.
- Handling missing values appropriately.
- Changing data types as needed.
- Clustering similar column values.
- Cleaning various columns to ensure data integrity.

## Visualization Techniques
The project employs several visualization techniques to present findings:
- **Countplot**: To visualize categorical data distributions.
- **Boxplot**: To identify outliers and understand data spread.
- **Barplot**: To compare different categories effectively.

## Results and Insights
The analysis provides insights into:
- The type of restaurants that are most successful based on sales data.
- Optimal locations for new restaurant openings.
- Recommended services that enhance customer satisfaction and sales.

## Future Work
Future enhancements for this project could include:
- Implementing machine learning models to predict sales trends.
- Expanding the dataset to include more features such as customer demographics or seasonal trends.
- Creating a web application for interactive data exploration.
